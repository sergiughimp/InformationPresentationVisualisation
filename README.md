# Lab 1: Coffee Sales Data Visualizations

## Introduction
This Lab 1 assignment explores a dataset of coffee sales (`coffee_sales.csv`) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navjotkaushal/coffee-sales-dataset) to check Python setup and practice data visualization. The dataset includes information about the time of sale, coffee type, payment method, amount spent, and other temporal details. The goal is to visualize patterns in sales, money spent, and trends over time using Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Visualizations

### Visualization 1: Total Money Spent per Coffee Type
A vertical bar chart showing the total money spent for each coffee type from the `coffee_sales.csv` dataset. This helps identify the most popular and profitable products.

### Visualization 2: Total Money Spent by Time of Day
A pie chart representing the proportion of total money spent across different times of the day (Morning, Afternoon, Evening, Night). This provides insight into peak sales periods.

### Visualization 3: Number of Sales per Weekday
A line chart showing the number of coffee sales for each weekday. This helps detect patterns in daily sales and identify busy or slow days.

### Visualization 4: Total Money Spent Over Time
A line chart illustrating total money spent per day. This visualizes trends over time and highlights any peaks or drops in sales.

### Visualization 5: Heatmap of Money Spent by Weekday and Time of Day
A Seaborn heatmap displaying money spent across weekdays and times of the day. This combines temporal dimensions to detect patterns and busiest periods.

## Summary
These visualizations provide an overview of coffee sales behavior from the `coffee_sales.csv` dataset, showing product popularity, peak hours, weekday trends, and overall sales patterns. This Lab 1 exercise also demonstrates the use of Matplotlib and Seaborn for effective data visualization in Python.

# Lab 2: Movies Data Visualizations

## Introduction
This Lab 2 assignment explores the Movies dataset from the Vega datasets library.  
The dataset includes information about movie titles, gross earnings, production budgets, release dates, ratings, and genres.  
The goal is to practice data visualization in Python using Altair and learn how to present data clearly and effectively.

## Task 1: Explore the Movies Dataset

**a) Load the Movies Dataset**  
Load the movies dataset using the Vega datasets library.

**b) Inspect Data Types and Preview Data**  
Check the first few rows and data types to understand the available information.

**c) Count the Number of Movies by Genre**  
A bar chart shows the number of movies in each major genre.  
This identifies which genres are most common and which are less frequent.
